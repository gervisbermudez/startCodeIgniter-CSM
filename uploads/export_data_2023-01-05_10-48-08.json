However, with the right design process in place, it is possible to create an app that not only looks great, but also helps users find the services they need in their area.<\/p><p>The Mobile APP is a design proposal that aims to help users easily locate services in their area. To create this app, we used Figma as our design tool. Figma allows us to quickly create and iterate on design concepts, making it an ideal choice for our design process.<\/p><p><img alt=\"portfolio-4-2022-12-07-051113\" src=\"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.com\/.\/dev\/uploads\/portfolio-4-2022-12-07-051113.png\"><br><\/p><p>The first step in the design process was to identify the target audience for the app. Our research indicated that the app would be most useful to people who are looking for services such as restaurants, grocery stores, or gas stations in their immediate area.<\/p><p>Next, we focused on creating a user-friendly interface that would make it easy for users to quickly find what they were looking for. We used clean, modern fonts and a simple color scheme to create a sleek and professional look for the app.<\/p><p>One of the key features of the Mobile APP is its map-based interface. The app uses the user's current location to provide them with a list of services in their immediate area. Users can also zoom in and out on the map to view more or less detail, depending on their needs.<\/p><p>To make the app even more user-friendly, we added a search function that allows users to search for specific services by name or keyword. This makes it easy for users to find exactly what they are looking for without having to scroll through a long list of options.<\/p><p>In addition to the map-based interface and search function, the Mobile APP also includes a number of other useful features. For example, users can save their favorite locations for quick access later, and they can also view reviews and ratings for each location to help them make informed decisions about which services to use.<\/p><p>Overall, the design process for the Mobile APP was focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing app that would help users quickly and easily find the services they need in their area. By using Figma and following a structured design process, we were able to create an app that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.<\/p>\n      <\/article>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"col-lg-4\">\n      <div class=\"portfolio-info\">\n        <h3>Project information<\/h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Category<\/strong>: Web Development<\/li>\n          <li><strong>Project date<\/strong>: 01 March, 2020<\/li>\n          <li><strong>Project URL<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/gervisbermudez\/startCodeIgniter-CSM\" title=\"startCodeIgniter-CSM GitHub\" target=\"_self\">startCodeIgniter-CSM<\/a><\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n      <\/div>\n\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>","json_content":[],"page_type_id":"1","user_id":"1","visibility":"1","categorie_id":"0","subcategorie_id":"0","status":"1","layout":"default","mainImage":"2105","thumbnailImage":null,"date_publish":"2022-12-29 16:29:53","date_update":null,"date_create":"2022-12-29 16:29:53","date_delete":null,"model_type":"page","page_data":{"title":"Mobile App Proposal","meta":[{"name":"author","content":"Gervis Mora"},{"name":"keywords","content":"Mobile App Proposal"},{"name":"description","content":"As a designer, creating a mobile app that is both functional and visually appealing is always a challenge.
